The NFL player tracking data presents an unique opportunity to automatize the process of breaking down film and tagging routes. More importantly, it gives an opportunity to examine methods to classify pattern of routes, so called route concepts. The present research will attempt to identify an already chosen route concept, using a combination of features devised from receiver route trajectories and certain characteristics regarding the specified route concept in pass plays. The hope is that this work will be complementary to an unsupervised machine learning model of basic route identification, which will be addressed in an upcoming paper. The eventual goal is to use a route identification model with a framework of identfying concepts in order to streamline the process of finding plays accross the NFL that include the same pass concept.
