# A/B Test Analysis {#rmd-basics}

## Main Findings

Previous attempts to identify American Football Routes and formations were done by using computer vision techniques looking at pixel density and weighted spatial of All-22 film. @barnett use this data to extract features such as quarterback position, number, and location of tight ends, running backs and receivers to identify formations. @jeremy utilize radio-frequency identification (RFID) tracking technology to monitor post-snap on field locations of offensive players. The 231 routes they extracted were then classified manually and then trained by a Naive-Bayes model. The most innovative aspect about work of @jeremy is how they apply their knowledge of the football domain to generate important feature extraction metrics from receiver routes. As they explain, basic receiver routes are comprised of three essential components: a stem, pivot, and branch. In order to extract important features such as stem length and branch direction, one has to first establish the turning points of receivers from trajectory data. They use Segmented Euclidean Regression, where they go over each frame and test each point in the route as a possible pivot point. The point with minimal Euclidean Error is established as route's true pivot point. Although mathematically sound, one can argue that this approach is far from perfect empirically. Although a good approximation, it takes $O(n^{2})$ time where n denotes the number of frames, making it highly slow in practice. We start by exploring an alternative method that can find "valuable" turning points by constructing an approximated trajectory. It should also be mentioned that frame by frame direction data provided by the dataset can be deceiving when trying to establish turning points, as the direction change takes multiple frames to complete, making it hard to use direction data to pinpoint the turning point the players.

## Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm
Basicly put, Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm, based on papers of @beckmann, @david and @ramer, is an algorithm for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points. The implementation of the algorithm in O(n logn) time in Python can be found [here.](https://github.com/fhirschmann/rdp) It does so by creating a simplified trajectory and finding turning turnings in between piece wise segments. The two figures below demonstrate the start and finish trajectories of the algorithm. The black points in the second figure represent the turning points found by using segmenting initial trajectories into simple trajectories. 
```{r rdp,echo=FALSE,fig.height= 10, fig.cap="Initial trajectory",out.extra="angle=360, scale=0.5"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/rdp1.png")

```

```{r rdp2,echo=FALSE,fig.height= 10, fig.cap="Turning points of simplified trajectory",out.extra="angle=360, scale=0.5"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/rdp2.png")

```
## Application of RDP Algorithm to Play Data
We can apply the above-described algorithm to find turning points in routes run by receivers in passing plays. Below is the simplified trajectory data from the same example play on NFL Football Operations Github Page, the 75-yard Tyreek Hill Touchdown from the Week 1 game between New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs. For simplification, only the trajectories of Chiefs receivers are displayed. In the graph, the starting ball point (the black circle) represents the origin (0,0). Every other player starting position at ball snap it adjusted accordingly. ^[This method will also be used in future to train a route classifier. The starting position of the receiver in respect to the ball from both sides can a valuable feature for successfully classifying routes.] In this play, we see 2 stacked receivers on each side of the ball. The routes of players are simplified using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. The red dots represent the valuable turning points in these simplified trajectories. The black cross presents the point where the pass was thrown. 
```{r 2756simple,echo=FALSE,fig.height= 10, fig.cap="A.Smith pass deep right to T.Hill for 75 yards. Light blue dashed line is the line of scrimmage. Ball on the right hashmark. Simplified trajectories are shown",out.extra="angle=360, scale=0.6"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/2756_simple.png")

```
We can then extract these turning points and save their location alongside the initial trajectories. Below is the same play, but the red turning points are displayed on initial trajectories. After extracting stem length, turning point and branch of every route, we can use this information to identify a certain concept in a play. Before doing so, additional information may be required in order to identify the concept, which is explained through an example in the next chapter. 
```{r 2756complex,echo=FALSE,fig.height= 10, fig.cap="The original trajectories of receivers alongside their turning points.",out.extra="angle=360, scale=0.6"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/2756.png")
